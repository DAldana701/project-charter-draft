This will involve me conducting a self-assessment of all my academic achievements, creating and tailoring application documents based on job requirements, communicating with professors and peers to increase confidence in applying to positions, and getting feedback on resumes and cover letters from stakeholders (professors, counselors, peers, etc.). This project will implement the cybersecurity knowledge I've learned thus far and bring me closer to my mission of finding working opportunities.</p>

By preparing application documents, gaining feedback, and applying to internships, I am working productively toward the same goal my mission highlights: pursuing opportunities that interest me while learning and growing from new experiences.</p>

<h4>Vision Alignment:</h4>
<p>This project supports and aligns with my vision by helping me secure an internship or part-time role in the CIS field. Finding, applying for, and securing a position through this project will move me toward financial stability while also providing valuable real-world experience.</p>

<h4>Strategic Goal Support:</h4>
<p>Conducting a job search will advance specific strategies, mainly expanding my network and self-learning. By engaging with my stakeholders, I will grow and establish a great network with individuals I can rely on now and in the future. Furthermore, this project will motivate me to conduct study plans and review cybersecurity concepts to ensure that my knowledge in this area meets manager and job requirements, and positions me to confidently pursue certifications in the future.</p>

<h4>Professional Value:</h4>
<p>Performing and completing this project will directly benefit my future career. I will learn new skills and strengthen existing ones throughout the execution of this project. It will also require me to engage with multiple stakeholders, thus building valuable connections and expanding my professional network. In addition, I will tailor application documents to specific job requirements, demonstrating commitment and genuine interest in each position I apply to.</p>

<h4>Personal Value:</h4>
<p>This project will help me grow in confidence, which I have struggled with in the past. I often compare myself to others and their experiences, which fuels my imposter syndrome. I will gain a supportive environment that increases my self-worth by stepping out of my comfort zone, expanding my network, and highlighting my academic achievements. With this growing confidence, I can focus more clearly on my journey and continue following my mission and vision.</p>

<h4>Learning Outcomes:</h4>
<p>From this project, I will gain important learning outcomes such as creating and tailoring resumes, cover letters, and portfolios. I will also strengthen technical skills and develop effective study plans. I will learn to showcase and highlight my experiences at networking events or through digital platforms like my portfolio and LinkedIn. Furthermore, I will strengthen my ability to communicate confidently at both professional and personal levels — whether in follow-ups, expressing interest, or casual conversations.</p>

<h4>Labor Costs</h4>
<p>The primary labor cost for this project is my own effort in developing deliverables, networking, and preparing application materials. Based on my WBS and duration estimates, I expect to spend approximately <strong>72–96 hours</strong> over the semester. Using a conservative student/entry-level market rate of <strong>$20/hour</strong>, this equates to a labor cost range of <strong>$1,440–$1,920</strong>.</p>

<h4>Contingency &amp; Risks</h4>
<p>Because this project primarily uses free student resources, overall budget risk is low. A <strong>15% contingency reserve</strong> is included to cover unexpected costs (e.g., materials, transportation, or optional services). Based on the estimates above, this contingency amounts to approximately <strong>$150–$250</strong>.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Risk 1 – Certification prep costs exceed plan:</strong> Mitigate by relying on free LinkedIn Learning and CSULA materials before purchasing guides.</li>
    <li><strong>Risk 2 – Event transportation/fees higher than expected:</strong> Mitigate by prioritizing free on-campus or virtual events.</li>
    <li><strong>Risk 3 – Additional printing or supplies needed:</strong> Mitigate by using digital distribution when possible and printing selectively.</li>

                    <p>This project follows a <em>Predictive methodology</em> because most deliverables are fixed in scope and follow a traditional sequence of planning, execution, monitoring, and closing. 
                    Examples include resume drafts, ISC2 CC preparation, and job applications. While some deliverables will go through iterative feedback (such as resume revisions), the majority of tasks are planned in advance with clear outcomes. 
                    This makes the predictive approach the best overall fit for my project.</p>

<h4>Tool Selection Explanation</h4>
<p>I looked at three tools for my project: <strong>Microsoft Project</strong>, <strong>Trello</strong>, and <strong>Monday.com</strong>.</p>
<p>At first, I thought about using Microsoft Project, but it felt like way too much for what I needed. There are a lot of features, and I knew I’d probably get overwhelmed. I also thought about Trello since I’ve used it before in other classes. Trello is great for quick boards, but it’s really better for Agile projects. Since my project is predictive, I felt it wasn’t the right match.</p>
<p>I ended up going with <strong>Monday.com</strong>. Honestly, when I first opened it, I felt overwhelmed too, but once I learned how to use it, I realized it was exactly what I needed. Monday.com let me group tasks by deliverables, set dependencies, and assign timelines. For example, I could clearly show that applying to jobs depends on finishing resumes, which depends on resume prep. It took me a couple of days to set everything up, but now I have a timeline that matches my WBS and methodology diagram (and the class schedule (PMI Process Group)). It helps me stay organized and keeps me from losing track of where I’m at during the semester.</p>
